Each user will have their own password. Whenever a user wants to enter through the door he needs to enter his password. If his password matches to the password that we have in our database then a blue LED will be activated and the door will automatically open. Then after a few seconds the door will be closed. If a user enters wrong password then our system will activate Red LED and give some audio signal and the door will remain close.
